		<h1>Instructions</h1>
    Welcome to Pocket Frogs!
    You are a frog breeder who specializes in multicolored frogs. Your frogs have 2 attributes: a base color, and an accent color.
    You can breed these frogs to create new color combinations. You have 10 habitats for your frogs to live in, for organization.
    These frogs also have maturity! In order to breed, the frogs must be fully grown, with maturity 3. You can increase a frog's maturity by feeding it. However, feed costs money!
    You can get money by selling frogs. See the pricing table below for more information on that.

		<h1>Pricing</h1>
    Each frog has a monetary value. This value is based off of it's phenotype. Rarer phenotypes are worth more. Here is a table showing the price of each color in a phenotype.
    Since a frog has two colors in it's phenotype, multiply the price of the base color by the price of the accent color to find the total value of the frog.
